# PR Review Summary - Sprint 8: Google Drive Integration Fixes

## Overview
This PR addresses all Codex review findings from the initial Google Drive file picker implementation, plus fixes critical markdown conversion issues discovered during testing.

## Commits in This PR

### 1. `e252157` - Initial Google Drive Picker Integration
- ✅ Implemented responsive file picker (desktop: Google Picker API, mobile: custom browser)
- ✅ OAuth2 browser-based authentication
- ✅ WYSIWYG markdown editor with TipTap
- ✅ Bidirectional conversion: Markdown ↔ HTML

### 2. `fd0103b` - Fix Codex Review Findings
**Addressed 4 Codex-identified issues:**
- ✅ **HIGH:** Fixed `setDeveloperKey()` validation (no empty string)
- ✅ **HIGH:** Verified `setAppId()` already correct (extracts project number)
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Added error callbacks to prevent picker premature close
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Fixed search query apostrophe escaping to prevent 400 errors

### 3. `55635e4` - Fix Markdown WYSIWYG Rendering
**Problem:** Files with escaped markdown (`\#`, `\*\*`, `\[^1\]`) weren't rendering in WYSIWYG format.

**Root Cause:** Turndown was escaping special characters when saving, then marked.js treated escaped characters as literal text on reload.

**Solution:** Added unescape logic before markdown→HTML conversion:
- Unescape: `\*` `\#` `\_` `\[` `\]` `` \` ``
- Ensures proper WYSIWYG display for existing escaped files

### 4. `7816c67` - Fix Cursor Jump Issue
**Problem:** Cursor jumped to end while typing.

**Root Cause:** Comparing markdown (value prop) to HTML (editor.getHTML()) triggered unnecessary re-renders.

**Solution:** Fixed comparison logic to compare markdown-to-markdown:
```typescript
const currentMarkdown = turndownService.turndown(editor.getHTML())
if (value !== currentMarkdown) { ... }
```

### 5. `68650a2` - Fix Codex Finding: Restore Turndown Escaping
**Codex Finding (HIGH):** Disabling turndown escaping caused content corruption for plain text containing markdown-like characters (e.g., `foo_bar` became italic).

**Root Cause:** The approach of disabling escaping entirely was wrong. The unescape logic already prevents double-escape accumulation on LOAD.

**Solution:** Reverted to default turndown escaping behavior. This ensures:
- Plain text like `foo_bar` saves as `foo\_bar` (correct)
- Unescape logic handles it properly on reload
- No content corruption from misinterpreted markdown

## Files Modified
- `.gitignore` - Excluded non-code folders
- `src/hooks/usePicker.ts` - Developer key validation, error handling
- `src/components/drive/DriveFilePicker.tsx` - Error handling, prevent premature close
- `src/hooks/useDriveFiles.ts` - Apostrophe escaping in search
- `src/components/Editor.tsx` - Markdown/HTML conversion, unescape logic, cursor fix

## Testing Checklist
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [x] Dev server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [x] Google Picker opens on desktop (≥768px viewport)
- [x] Custom file browser works on mobile (<768px viewport)
- [x] Files with escaped markdown render correctly in WYSIWYG
- [x] Typing works without cursor jumping
- [x] Save/reload cycle doesn't accumulate escapes
- [x] Search queries with apostrophes work correctly

## Ready for Codex Review
