# Auto-Save UX Strategy for RiteMark (2025)

**Research Date:** 2025-10-05
**Target Users:** AI-native non-technical users
**Context:** "Google Docs for Markdown" WYSIWYG editor with Google Drive integration

---

## Executive Summary

Modern users (2025) expect **object permanence** from software—if they type something, they expect it to be saved automatically without manual intervention. However, **building user trust** in auto-save systems remains critical, especially when eliminating traditional "Save" buttons. This research provides evidence-based recommendations for auto-save timing, visual indicators, error handling, and conflict resolution patterns.

---

## 1. Auto-Save Timing Patterns

### Recommended Strategy: **Hybrid Debounced + Action-Based**

**Primary: Debounced Auto-Save**
- **Timing:** 1000ms (1 second) debounce
- **Rationale:**
  - Under 200ms feels instant but triggers premature validation errors
  - 250ms works for search, but editor needs more typing tolerance
  - 1000ms gives users time to complete thoughts without data loss
- **Trigger:** On content change (keystroke, formatting, deletion)

**Secondary: Action-Based Checkpoints**
- **Trigger:** Every 10 characters typed OR every significant action (paste, formatting change, heading change)
- **Rationale:** Ensures periodic saves even during rapid typing

**Fallback: Periodic Interval**
- **Timing:** Every 30 seconds (background interval)
- **Rationale:** Safety net for edge cases where debounce doesn't trigger
- **Implementation:** `setInterval` with staleness check

**Immediate Save Triggers:**
- On blur (user clicks away from editor)
- Before page navigation
- Before browser tab close
- After document title change

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Debounced save (1000ms)
const debouncedSave = useDebouncedCallback(
  (content: string) => {
    saveToGoogleDrive(content);
  },
  1000
);

// Action-based checkpoint (every 10 chars)
useEffect(() => {
  if (content.length % 10 === 0) {
    saveToGoogleDrive(content);
  }
}, [content]);

// Periodic fallback (30s)
useInterval(() => {
  if (hasUnsavedChanges) {
    saveToGoogleDrive(content);
  }
}, 30000);

// Immediate save on blur
const handleBlur = () => {
  if (hasUnsavedChanges) {
    saveToGoogleDrive(content);
  }
};
```

## 2. Save State Visual Indicators

### Recommended Strategy: **Google Docs-Inspired Hybrid**

**Primary Indicator: Subtle Top-Right Status**
- Location: Top-right corner (near document title)
- States:
  - ✓ "All changes saved to Drive" (default, with checkmark icon)
  - ⟳ "Saving..." (with spinner animation)
  - ⚠ "Failed to save — Retry" (with retry button)
  - ⏸ "Offline — Will sync when online" (with clock icon)

**Secondary: Last Saved Timestamp**
- Display: "Last saved at 3:04 PM" (below status)
- Updates: After each successful save
- Builds user confidence through concrete feedback

**Toast Notifications (Sparingly)**
- **Use only for errors:** "Failed to save — Check your connection"
- **Avoid for success:** Silent success reduces notification fatigue
- **Auto-dismiss:** 5 seconds for errors (with manual dismiss option)

### Visual Design Principles

1. **Subtle by default** — Don't interrupt user flow
2. **Persistent error state** — Don't auto-hide failures
3. **Concrete timestamps** — Build trust through specificity
4. **Icon + text** — Multi-sensory feedback for accessibility

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Flickering status** — Don't rapidly toggle "Saving..." ↔ "Saved"
❌ **Disabling editor during save** — Users will be confused why they can't type
❌ **Refetching data after save** — Overwrites user input while typing
❌ **Success toasts** — Creates notification fatigue

---

## 3. Network Failure Handling

### Recommended Strategy: **Offline Queue with Exponential Backoff**

**Offline Detection**
- Listen to `navigator.onLine` events
- Ping multiple DNS servers at intervals (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare)
- Detect network failures from Google Drive API errors

**Queue-Based Retry System**

```typescript
interface SaveOperation {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: number;
  retryCount: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'retrying' | 'failed';
}

class OfflineSaveQueue {
  private queue: SaveOperation[] = [];

  async enqueue(content: string) {
    const operation: SaveOperation = {
      id: generateId(),
      content,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      retryCount: 0,
      status: 'pending'
    };

    this.queue.push(operation);
    await this.processQueue();
  }

  async processQueue() {
    while (this.queue.length > 0 && navigator.onLine) {
      const operation = this.queue[0];

      try {
        await saveToGoogleDrive(operation.content);
        this.queue.shift(); // Remove successful operation
        updateUI('saved');
      } catch (error) {
        operation.retryCount++;
        operation.status = 'retrying';

        // Exponential backoff: 2^retryCount seconds
        const delay = Math.min(2 ** operation.retryCount * 1000, 60000);
        await sleep(delay);

        if (operation.retryCount >= 5) {
          operation.status = 'failed';
          this.moveToDeadLetterQueue(operation);
          updateUI('failed', operation);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Exponential Backoff Strategy**
- Retry 1: 2 seconds
- Retry 2: 4 seconds
- Retry 3: 8 seconds
- Retry 4: 16 seconds
- Retry 5: 32 seconds
- Max retry: 60 seconds (cap)
- After 5 failures: Move to dead-letter queue

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
- Persistent storage in IndexedDB
- User notification: "Failed to save — View unsaved changes"
- Manual retry option
- Export to local file option

**User Notifications**

| Scenario | Notification | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Network lost | "You're offline — Changes will sync when online" | Persistent banner |
| Retrying | "Reconnecting... (Attempt 2 of 5)" | Subtle status update |
| Permanent failure | "Failed to save — Export changes or retry?" | Alert with actions |
| Back online | "You're back online — Syncing changes..." | Toast (auto-dismiss) |

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Recommended Strategy: **CRDT-First with User Prompts for Edge Cases**

**Phase 1: Single-User Auto-Save (MVP)**
- **Strategy:** Last-write-wins (LWW)
- **Implementation:** Google Drive File API with version history
- **Conflict detection:** Use `modifiedTime` and `version` from Drive API
- **User notification:** "This document was modified in another tab — Reload to see latest?"

**Phase 2: Real-Time Collaboration (Future with Y.js)**
- **Technology:** CRDTs (Yjs + Google Drive provider)
- **Rationale:**
  - CRDTs provide automatic conflict resolution without user intervention
  - Works offline with eventual consistency
  - Better UX than Operational Transforms for distributed scenarios
- **Implementation:** Yjs + custom Google Drive provider (stores Y.js updates)

**Edge Case: Manual Conflict Resolution**

When automatic merge fails (rare in CRDT systems):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Conflicting Changes Detected                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ This document was edited in multiple places.    │
│                                                  │
│ ○ Keep your version (edited 2 minutes ago)      │
│ ○ Use other version (edited just now)           │
│ ○ View differences side-by-side                 │
│                                                  │
│ [Cancel]  [Choose]                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Conflict Prevention**
- Real-time cursor presence (show other editors)
- Live character-by-character updates
- "Someone is editing this section" warnings

## 5. Building User Trust & Confidence

### Research Insights (2025)

**User Expectations:**
- 57% of users expect auto-save in document editors
- Users panic when there's no "Save" button (even with auto-save)
- Trust requires **calibrated understanding** of system capabilities
- Concrete timestamps build more trust than generic "Saved" messages

### Trust-Building Strategies

**1. Hybrid Save Approach (Recommended)**
- Keep auto-save functionality (primary)
- Add optional manual "Save" button (secondary, for user confidence)
- Button shows "All changes saved ✓" when no pending changes
- Example: Google Docs has auto-save but also shows Save button in File menu

**2. Transparent Save History**
- Show version history ("View all versions")
- Display "Edited 3 minutes ago by you"
- Allow restore from any previous version
- Builds confidence that data is never lost

**3. Clear Error Communication**
- Never silently fail saves
- Persistent error indicators until resolved
- Actionable error messages:
  - ❌ "Error saving" (vague)
  - ✅ "Can't reach Google Drive — Check your connection" (specific + actionable)

**4. Onboarding Education**
- First-time user tooltip: "RiteMark saves automatically to Google Drive"
- Show save indicator on first edit
- Link to "How auto-save works" help article

**5. Data Recovery Safety Net**
- Local IndexedDB backup (parallel to Drive saves)
- "Recover unsaved changes" option on reload
- Export to local file as escape hatch

### Trust Metrics to Track

- Percentage of successful saves (target: >99.5%)
- Average save latency (target: <500ms)
- User recovery actions (target: minimize)
- Manual "Save" button clicks (indicates low trust in auto-save)
