# Sprint 2: Advanced Google Cloud CI/CD Integration - Audit Report

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement Apps Script API deployment to replace CLASP with professional CI/CD  
**Phase**: Audit & Research (Phase 1 of 5)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the technical requirements and implementation strategy for upgrading from manual CLASP deployment to automated Apps Script API-based CI/CD pipeline. The research reveals multiple approaches with varying complexity and security profiles, requiring careful architectural decisions.

**Key Finding**: Direct conversion from default to standard Google Cloud project is **not possible** - requires creating new standard project and migration.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Apps Script Configuration
- **Project Name**: RiteMark
- **Script ID**: `1yP2OjKRYPu3NJ91Y0zdYS4iFSyhtbv11FHXW8ZCPKTvt7jwdontBKuU4`
- **Project Type**: Default Google Cloud project (auto-created)
- **Configuration**: Web app with `USER_DEPLOYING` execution, `ANYONE` access
- **Runtime**: V8, Stackdriver logging enabled
- **Current Deployment**: Manual via CLASP

### Integration Challenges Identified in Sprint 1
1. **GitHub Actions Secret Masking**: CLASP credential files (.clasprc.json) trigger security masking
2. **Credential File Dependencies**: Brittle deployment process requiring file management
3. **Limited Deployment Control**: No version management or rollback capabilities
4. **Authentication Complexity**: OAuth flows not suitable for CI/CD automation

---

## Research Findings

### 1. Apps Script API Authentication Patterns

#### Primary Challenge: Service Account Limitations
**Critical Discovery**: Google Apps Script **does not support direct service account execution**. Apps Script API requires a real user identity who has turned ON the ‚ÄúGoogle Apps Script API‚Äù in user settings. A bare service account cannot satisfy this per-user check.

#### Workaround Architectures Identified:

**A. OAuth2 Library Integration**
- Use Apps Script's OAuth2 library for service account credential handling
- Store tokens in Apps Script Properties service
- Requires Apps Script-side authentication wrapper

**B. Web App Proxy Pattern**
- Deploy Apps Script as Web App with "Execute as: Me" and "Anyone with Google account"
- Service account triggers Web App endpoints
- Script runs with owner permissions, not service account

**C. Apps Script API for Deployment Only (with real user identity)**
- Use service account for CI, but calls must run as a real user:
  - Workspace: Service account with Domain‚Äëwide Delegation (DWD) impersonates a user who has Apps Script API enabled and edit access to the script.
  - Consumer Gmail: Use 3‚Äëlegged OAuth (user refresh token) in CI.
- Runtime execution: Standard web app auth as designed.

#### Recommended Approach: Option C
Apps Script API deployment with service account authentication for CI/CD, while maintaining standard OAuth for runtime execution.

### 2. Google Cloud Project Architecture

#### Default vs Standard Project Requirements

**Default Project Limitations:**
- Cannot be converted to standard project
- Limited API access and configuration options
- Suitable only for simple scripts
- No marketplace publishing capability

**Standard Project Benefits:**
- Full Google Cloud API access
- Custom IAM roles and service accounts
- Advanced logging and monitoring
- Required for marketplace publishing
- Enables Apps Script API access

#### Migration Strategy Required
**Cannot Convert**: Default ‚Üí Standard project conversion is impossible  
**Must Create**: New standard Google Cloud project  
**Migration Steps**:
1. Create new standard GCP project
2. Enable required APIs (Apps Script API, IAM, etc.)
3. Switch Apps Script project association
4. Configure service accounts and permissions
5. Test deployment pipeline

### 3. Service Account Best Practices

#### Security Principles (2025 Standards)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions only
- **Key Management**: Avoid long-lived JSON keys where possible
- **Workload Identity Federation**: Preferred over service account keys
- **Role Restrictions**: Use specific roles vs. broad Editor access

#### Required Permissions for Apps Script API
- Core requirement is a real user context:
  - Workspace: Enable Domain‚Äëwide Delegation on the service account and authorize scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects` in Admin console. The impersonated user must have Editor/Owner access to the Apps Script project and must toggle Apps Script API ON in user settings.
  - Consumer: Use 3‚Äëlegged OAuth and store the refresh token in GitHub Secrets.
- Notes:
  - GCP roles like `roles/script.developer` are not strictly required for Apps Script API if the impersonated user has access to the script; authorization is determined by Drive sharing on the script file.
  - If using Workload Identity Federation, the GitHub principal needs `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the target service account.

### 4. GitHub Actions Authentication Options

#### Option A: Workload Identity Federation (Recommended)
**Benefits:**
- No long-lived credentials in GitHub Secrets
- Short-lived tokens with fine-grained permissions
- Automatic token rotation
- Enhanced security posture

**Requirements:**
- Configure Workload Identity Pool
- Set up provider mappings
- Modify GitHub Actions workflows

#### Option B: Service Account JSON Keys (Current Standard)
**Benefits:**
- Simpler initial setup
- Well-documented patterns
- Immediate implementation possible

**Drawbacks:**
- Long-lived credentials requiring rotation
- Security risk if compromised
- Manual key management overhead

#### Recommendation: Start with Option B, Migrate to Option A
For Sprint 2, implement service account JSON keys for faster delivery, with planned migration to Workload Identity Federation in Sprint 3.

## CI/CD Feasibility Verdict and Auth Requirements

- Feasibility: Yes ‚Äî fully feasible and widely used in production.
- Required Auth Model:
  - Workspace domains: Service account with Domain‚Äëwide Delegation impersonating a real user (who has Apps Script API enabled and edit access to the script).
  - Consumer Gmail: 3‚Äëlegged OAuth with refresh token stored in GitHub Secrets.
- Not Enough: A bare service account credential (JSON or WIF) without user impersonation will fail with `PERMISSION_DENIED` referring to user settings.
- Security: Prefer WIF to avoid JSON keys; DWD does not require an OAuth consent screen. 3‚Äëlegged OAuth requires a consent screen and careful secret handling.

### **Required Technology Stack:**
- **Google Cloud Project**: New standard project (cannot convert existing default)
- **Authentication**: Service Account JSON keys stored in GitHub Secrets
- **API**: Google Apps Script API v1 via googleapis Node.js library
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with google-github-actions/auth@v2
- **Version Control**: Git tags for deployment versioning

### **Required Secrets (Only 2):**
1. `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` - Service account JSON key
2. `APPS_SCRIPT_ID` - Apps Script project ID (1yP2OjKRYPu3NJ91Y0zdYS4iFSyhtbv11FHXW8ZCPKTvt7jwdontBKuU4)

### **Rejected Alternatives:**
- ‚ùå **Workload Identity Federation**: Too complex for 3-day sprint (defer to Sprint 3)
- ‚ùå **Cloud Build Integration**: Overkill for current needs, adds unnecessary complexity
- ‚ùå **Default Project Conversion**: Impossible - Google doesn't allow conversion
- ‚ùå **Keep CLASP**: High failure rate, credential masking issues unresolved
