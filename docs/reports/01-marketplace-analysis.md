## 1. Google Workspace Marketplace Requirements & Approval Process

### Core Requirements (2024-2025)

**Application Standards:**
- App name, developer information, and description must be accurate and compliant
- Must be fully functional and bug-free with positive user experience
- High-quality graphics including icons and screenshots
- Correct OAuth verification and scope usage
- Must integrate with at least one Google Workspace service using Core APIs

**OAuth Integration Requirements:**
- OAuth2 support for automatic account creation and login
- No authorization consent prompts after admin installation
- Minimum required scopes (avoid sensitive/restricted scopes when possible)
- Complete scope listing matching OAuth consent screen

**Data Security & Privacy:**
- Transparent data handling disclosure
- Secure data transmission via modern cryptography
- Compliance with Google API Services User Data Policy
- Limited data use to disclosed practices only

### Approval Process Timeline

**Standard Review:** Several days for initial review
**Re-approval Triggers:** Only when adding/removing integrations (as of 2024)
**Scope Changes:** Add to OAuth Consent Screen first, then to Marketplace SDK after approval

### Common Rejection Reasons

1. **OAuth Issues:**
   - Incorrect consent screen setup (Internal user type or Testing status)
   - Incomplete OAuth verification
   - Inappropriate scope usage

2. **Trademark Violations:**
   - Improper use of Google trademarks in app name, logo, or descriptions

3. **Functionality Issues:**
   - Incomplete or buggy application
   - Poor user experience or graphics quality

### Recent Updates (2025)

- **August 2025:** Updated Developer Agreement and approval workflow improvements
- **September 2024:** Introduction of draft functionality for app publishing
- **Gradual Rollouts:** Up to 15 days for feature visibility in some cases

## 2. File Handler Integration Patterns for .md Files

### Native Markdown Support (July 2024)

Google introduced native markdown support in Google Docs:
- **Import:** Upload .md files directly to Google Docs
- **Export:** File > Download > Markdown (.md)
- **Integration:** Right-click uploaded files > Open with Google Docs

### OAuth Scopes for File Handling

**Recommended Scopes:**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `drive.file` scope for granular user control
- Implement Google Picker API for optimal user experience
- Choose most narrowly focused scopes possible
- Allow users to select which files to share with app

### Integration Methods

**1. Google Docs Integration:**
- Direct file upload and conversion
- Native markdown import/export capabilities
- Seamless user experience with existing workflows

**2. Apps Script Integration:**
- Use `Drive.Files.create()` with `mimeType: MimeType.GOOGLE_DOCS`
- Conversion between Google Docs and Markdown formats
- Server-side processing capabilities

**3. Drive API with OAuth:**
- Full programmatic access to Drive files
- Custom file handling and processing
- Enhanced security with user-controlled access

### File Handler Best Practices

- Implement proper MIME type associations for .md files
- Support both read and write operations
- Provide clear file conflict resolution
- Offer real-time collaboration features where applicable
- Ensure mobile compatibility (common pain point in existing apps)

## 3. OAuth Scopes Needed for Drive File Editing

### Essential Scopes for Markdown Editors

**Core Drive Access:**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
```
- Most secure option - users choose specific files
- Recommended by Google for optimal user experience
- Builds user trust through granular permissions

**Document Access:**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly
```
- Required for Google Docs integration
- currentonly provides more limited access scope

**UI and Container:**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui
```
- Needed for embedded UI experiences
- Required for add-on interfaces

### Advanced Integration Scopes

**Broader Drive Access (use cautiously):**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
```
- Full Drive access - requires strong justification
- Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary
- May trigger additional review requirements

**File Download/Export:**
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
```
- For apps focused on viewing/exporting
- Good for conversion-only tools

### OAuth Implementation Strategy

**Progressive Permission Model:**
1. Start with minimal scopes for core functionality
2. Request additional permissions as features are used
3. Clearly explain permission requirements to users
4. Implement graceful degradation for denied permissions

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never request unnecessary scopes
- Use service accounts for server-side operations
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Store credentials securely
