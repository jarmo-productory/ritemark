# Naming Rationale: Ritemark

The name "Ritemark" was chosen for the product due to its multiple layers of meaning, which align directly with the core product strategy.

The name works on three distinct levels:

1.  **Rite as in "Write"**: It directly references the primary function of the application—writing and editing markdown content.

2.  **Rite as in "Right-click"**: It subtly hints at the key user action and primary integration point: using the "right-click" context menu to open and edit files.

3.  **Rite as in "Ritual/Standard"**: It aligns with the strategic vision for the product to become the standard, definitive tool—the correct "rite" or procedure—for handling markdown files within the Google Workspace ecosystem.

This combination makes the name memorable, meaningful, and strategically relevant.
