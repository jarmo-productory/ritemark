# RiteMark Validation Playbook: From Assumptions to Evidence

## ðŸŽ¯ THE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

This playbook provides step-by-step instructions for validating whether RiteMark should exist and what problem it should solve.

## ðŸ“‹ WEEK 1: PROBLEM DISCOVERY

### Day 1-2: User Interview Setup

#### Interview Script Template
```
Hi [Name], thanks for agreeing to this 30-minute call. I'm researching challenges people face with text editing and document creation. I'm not selling anything - just trying to understand real problems.

WORKFLOW QUESTIONS:
1. Walk me through how you created your last important document
2. What tools did you use? Why those specific tools?
3. Where did the process break down or frustrate you?
4. Show me an example if possible

PAIN POINT PROBING:
5. What takes longer than it should in your writing process?
6. When do you find yourself switching between tools? Why?
7. What would need to happen for you to switch to a new editor?
8. What's the most annoying thing about your current setup?

CONTEXT QUESTIONS:
9. How often do you write/edit text documents? (daily/weekly/monthly)
10. Do you collaborate with others on documents? How?
11. What formats do you typically work with? Why?

SOLUTION VALIDATION:
12. If I could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your writing workflow, what would it be?
13. How much would fixing that be worth to you per month?
14. What have you tried to solve this problem already?
```

#### Recruitment Strategy
**Where to find users:**
- **Reddit**: r/writing, r/markdown, r/productivity, r/webdev, r/techwriting
- **Twitter**: Tweet asking for volunteers, use hashtags #markdown #writing #productivity
- **LinkedIn**: Post in technical writing and content creation groups
- **Discord**: Join productivity and writing communities
- **Calendly**: Set up easy scheduling link

**Recruitment Message:**
```
"Researching writing/editing challenges - looking for 20 people to chat for 30 minutes about their document creation workflows. Not selling anything, just trying to understand real problems. $10 Amazon gift card as thanks. Interested? [Calendly link]"
```

### Day 3-4: Competitive Deep Dive

#### Testing Protocol
**For each markdown editor, document:**
1. **First impression** (0-5 minutes of use)
2. **Core workflow** (create, edit, save, share a document)
3. **Friction points** (what's annoying or confusing?)
4. **Unique strengths** (what does this do better than others?)
5. **User reviews** (read recent reviews, note common complaints)

#### Editors to Test (Minimum 15)
**Free/Freemium:**
- Typora, MarkText, Zettlr, HackMD, Dillinger, StackEdit
- GitHub editor, GitLab editor, Notion, Obsidian
- VSCode with markdown extensions, Atom, Sublime Text

**Premium:**
- Ulysses, Bear, iA Writer, Marked 2
- Craft, Roam Research, RemNote

#### Analysis Framework
```
EDITOR: [Name]
FIRST IMPRESSION (1-10):
CORE STRENGTH:
BIGGEST WEAKNESS:
USER COMPLAINTS (from reviews):
PRICING MODEL:
TARGET AUDIENCE:
UNIQUE FEATURE:
DEAL-BREAKER BUG/ISSUE:
```

### Day 5: Pattern Recognition

#### Synthesis Questions
1. **What problems came up in multiple interviews?**
2. **What complaints appear across multiple editors?**
3. **What workflows are currently impossible or very difficult?**
4. **Where are users "hiring" multiple tools to solve one job?**
5. **What would users pay most to fix?**

## ðŸ“Š WEEK 2: HYPOTHESIS FORMATION

### Problem Statement Template
```
[Specific user type] struggles with [specific situation] because [root cause], which leads to [concrete negative outcome]. They currently [current workaround/solution] but this [why current solution is inadequate].

They would pay $[amount] per month to [specific outcome/benefit] because [business impact/personal value].

We can solve this by [solution approach] which would be [differentiation from existing solutions].
```

### Example Problem Statements
**Hypothesis 1: The Technical Writer's Context Problem**
```
Technical writers at software companies struggle with maintaining consistent documentation across multiple platforms (GitHub, Confluence, web docs) because markdown rendering differs between platforms, which leads to 2-3 hours per week fixing formatting issues. They currently write in VS Code and manually copy/paste/reformat for each platform, but this creates version control problems and formatting inconsistencies. They would pay $15/month to have a single editor that previews exactly how content will look on each platform because it would save 10+ hours per month and reduce documentation errors.
```

**Hypothesis 2: The Collaboration Problem**
```
Content teams at small companies (3-10 people) struggle with collaborative markdown editing because existing tools either lack real-time collaboration (GitHub) or don't preserve markdown (Google Docs), which leads to version conflicts and lost formatting. They currently email markdown files back and forth or use Google Docs and convert to markdown later, but this creates double work and formatting errors. They would pay $10 per user per month for Google Docs-quality collaboration that maintains markdown integrity because it would eliminate file versioning chaos and reduce content production time by 30%.
```

### Validation Experiments Design

#### Experiment 1: Landing Page Test
**For each hypothesis, create:**
- Simple landing page describing the problem and solution
- Clear value proposition
- Email signup form
- Basic analytics tracking

**Success criteria:** 5%+ conversion rate from targeted traffic

#### Experiment 2: Problem Survey
**Send to 100+ people in target audience:**
- 5 questions maximum
- Focus on problem severity and current solutions
- Include willingness-to-pay question
- Use Typeform or similar for good UX

**Success criteria:** 30%+ report this as a significant problem

#### Experiment 3: Solution Mockup Test
**Create simple mockups showing:**
- The current painful workflow
- How our solution would improve it
- Share with interview participants for feedback

**Success criteria:** 70%+ say this would improve their workflow

### Red Flag Indicators
**Stop if you see:**
- Less than 20% of interviewed users have the problem you're solving
- Users consistently say "nice to have" rather than "need to have"
- Existing solutions work "well enough" for most users
- No willingness to pay more than $5/month
- Can't clearly explain the problem in one sentence

### Green Light Indicators
**Continue if you see:**
- 50%+ of users have this specific problem regularly
- Users actively seeking solutions or trying multiple tools
- Clear willingness to pay $10+/month
- Existing solutions have obvious, frustrating limitations
- You can explain the value proposition in 10 seconds

## ðŸš€ WEEK 5+: MVP DEVELOPMENT (If Validated)

### Lean MVP Principles
1. **Single Core Feature**: Solve one problem extremely well
2. **Manual Tasks**: Use humans for complex automation initially
3. **Existing Tools**: Build on proven platforms/APIs when possible
4. **Feedback Loop**: Daily user contact during development
5. **Metrics Obsession**: Measure everything, optimize based on data

### MVP Feature Prioritization
**Must Have (Week 1 of development):**
- Core problem-solving feature
- Basic user interface
- Simple onboarding

**Should Have (Week 2):**
- User feedback mechanism
- Basic analytics
- Error handling

**Could Have (Week 3-4):**
- Additional features only if users ask
- Polish and optimization
- Integration features

**Won't Have (Until user validation):**
- Complex integrations
- Premium features
- Advanced customization

## ðŸ“Š ONGOING METRICS

### Validation Phase Metrics
- **User interviews completed**: Target 20
- **Problem confirmation rate**: Target 70%+
- **Willingness to pay**: Target $10+/month
- **Landing page conversion**: Target 5%+
- **Competitive gaps identified**: Target 3+ clear gaps

### MVP Phase Metrics (If you get there)
- **User activation rate**: % who complete key action
- **User retention**: % who return after 1 week
- **Problem-solution fit**: % who say product solves their problem
- **Net Promoter Score**: How likely to recommend?
- **Conversion to paid**: % willing to pay for full version

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS DEFINITION

**By end of Week 4, you should have:**
1. **Evidence-based problem statement** that real users care about
2. **Clear target market** of reachable, paying customers
3. **Validated solution approach** that users want and will pay for
4. **Competitive differentiation** that's meaningful to users
5. **Go-to-market strategy** for reaching your target audience

**If you don't have these five things with strong evidence, don't start building.**

The goal is not to validate that RiteMark as currently conceived should exist, but to discover what problem is actually worth solving in the text editing space - or to learn that no such opportunity exists for this team at this time.
