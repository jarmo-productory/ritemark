- **Progressive disclosure**: Essential features first, advanced features optional
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate formatting without syntax exposure
- **Error prevention**: Guards against broken markdown states

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Touch-optimized**: 44px minimum touch targets, gesture support
- **Responsive toolbar**: Essential actions visible, secondary actions collapsible
- **Performance optimized**: Fast loading on mobile networks
- **Battery efficient**: Optimized rendering and updates

## Cloud Integration Strategy

### Google Drive Sync Architecture
**Challenge**: Google Drive Realtime API is deprecated
**Solution**: Hybrid approach combining Google Drive storage with Y.js real-time sync

**Implementation:**
- **Real-time layer**: Y.js CRDT + WebSocket for immediate collaboration
- **Persistence layer**: Google Drive API for document storage and sharing
- **Sync strategy**: Real-time edits via WebSocket, periodic saves to Drive
- **Offline support**: IndexedDB caching with automatic sync when online

### Collaboration Features
- **Multi-user editing**: Real-time cursor positions and selections
- **Conflict resolution**: Automatic Y.js CRDT merging
- **User presence**: Visual indicators of active collaborators
- **Permission management**: Google Drive's native sharing controls

## AI Integration Architecture

### Future-Ready Design
The architecture includes extensible hooks for AI writing assistance:
- **Plugin system**: AI capabilities as Milkdown plugins
- **Context awareness**: Access to document state and user intent
- **Multiple providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI support
- **Privacy controls**: Content sanitization and user consent

### Planned AI Features
- **Text completion**: GitHub Copilot-style suggestions
- **Content enhancement**: Grammar, style, and tone improvements
- **Document analysis**: Readability scores and improvement suggestions
- **Smart generation**: Outline creation and content expansion

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technology Stack
```typescript
const techStack = {
  frontend: 'React 18 + TypeScript',
  editor: 'Milkdown v7+ with ProseMirror',
  collaboration: 'Y.js with WebSocket provider',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS + custom design tokens',
  bundling: 'Vite for fast development',
  testing: 'Vitest + React Testing Library',
  deployment: 'Docker + CDN for static assets'
};
```

### Performance Characteristics
