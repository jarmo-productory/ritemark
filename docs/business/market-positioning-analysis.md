- "WYSIWYG makes me feel on-edge, like it's an unpredictable mess under the buttons"
- Preference for markdown's focus on content over layout

#### Non-Technical User Pain Points with Markdown
- "It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you're accustomed to WYSIWYG applications"
- "I have observed people struggle with Markdown syntax, and be demotivated in their jobs as editors and content creators"
- "A lot of my users are in middle/high school and might get frustrated with a 'codey' experience"

#### The Bridge: Successful Collaboration Patterns
- **Real-time collaboration**: Google Docs success shows demand for simultaneous editing
- **Live preview**: Emerging trend in markdown editors toward WYSIWYG-style interfaces
- **Cloud-native**: Teams expect seamless access across devices and platforms
