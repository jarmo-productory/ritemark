# AI-Native Non-Technical User Research Report

## Executive Summary

This research provides evidence-based insights into the pain points of AI-native non-technical users with current markdown editors. The findings reveal a significant market gap: current markdown editors are designed for developers, intimidating AI-native content creators who need visual, collaborative tools with seamless AI integration.

## Evidence-Based Research Findings with Verified Sources

### 1. Markdown Syntax Barriers for Non-Technical Users

**Source**: [UX Stack Exchange - Is Markdown Friendly Enough for Non-Technical Users?](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/15919/is-markdown-friendly-enough-for-non-technical-users)

**Verified User Complaints:**
- **Ellie P.**: "Tags that require character-level precision" like precise spacing in links and lists
- **Ellie P.**: "Two spaces are invisible" when trying to create line breaks, users "often not confident that X will work"
- **Breton**: His clients "couldn't cope" with markup languages at all
- **Breton**: Even as a technical user, found Markdown "not easy enough for TECHNICAL users"
- **Keith**: About one-third of web users "can't scan text" and will struggle with any markup
- **Keith**: Low computer confidence doesn't mean users are "stupid"

**Jon Cage's Audience Assessment:**
- Markdown's difficulty depends entirely on "your audience"
- Suggested adding helper buttons to guide less technical users
- Emphasized the need for thoughtful implementation with clear guides and preview options

### 2. Current Editor UX Problems

**Learning Curve Issues:**
- "Learning Markdown from scratch is not easy, especially if you have never coded before"
- "You have to learn a whole new writing experience" requiring "a big change in one's writing habits"
- Users with non-tech backgrounds find the syntax-based approach intimidating

**Interface Intimidation:**
- Twitter described as "intimidating site, full of unfamiliar terms and strange rules"
- "140 character bursts" appear as "disjointed and disconnected chaos" to new users
- Technical editors create barrier to entry for content creators

### 2. Strong Demand for WYSIWYG Markdown Editors

**Source**: [GitHub Discussion #3092 - NiceGUI WYSIWYG Markdown Editor](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/discussions/3092)

**User Pain Points with Current Editors:**
- "Almost all of the WYSIWYG editors only have the split screen option which shows the live output, but doesn't allow you to edit that directly"
- Users want to "edit the live preview of Markdown" rather than working with two separate panels
- Current solutions like SimpleMDE only update editor view without true live rendering

**Source**: [GitHub Issue #5894 - MkDocs Material WYSIWYG Request](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/5894)

**Motivation for Non-Technical Users:**
- "This would allow non-tech people to focus on content creation"
- Current markdown editing creates "friction points" that interrupt content creators' workflow
- Goal to "combine the power of git versioning, the simplicity of markdown, with an actually amazing user experience"
- Want users to "focus on the content and nothing else" (inspired by Notion's approach)

### 3. Google's Validation of Market Demand

**Source**: [Google Workspace Updates - Import and Export Markdown in Google Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/07/import-and-export-markdown-in-google-docs.html)

**Enterprise Demand Evidence:**
- Google specifically called markdown import/export "highly-requested features"
- Added in July 2024 to "enhance Docs' interoperability with other Markdown supporting tools"
- Shows clear enterprise demand for markdown-Google Docs integration workflows

### 4. Additional Research Insights from GitHub Discussions
