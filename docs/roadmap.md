# RiteMark Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission
**"Google Docs for Markdown"** - WYSIWYG editor for AI-native non-technical users who need visual editing with cloud collaboration and markdown output.

### 🔄 Sprint Rules for AI Development
1. **Maximum 1 PR per sprint** (enforce small increments)
2. **Single feature per sprint** (no combining features)
3. **Working demo after each sprint** (always deployable)
4. **Validate before next sprint** (test with real usage)
5. **Document decisions** (maintain context for AI agents)
6. **Distraction-free focus** (no split-screens, no preview panes)
7. **Pageless writing experience** (continuous flow, no artificial breaks)

## 📈 Success Metrics Per Sprint
- **Sprint Success**: Feature works as expected
- **Integration Success**: No breaking changes
- **User Success**: Can complete intended action
- **Technical Success**: Code quality maintained
