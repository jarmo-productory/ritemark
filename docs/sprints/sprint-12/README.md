# Sprint 12: Image Support

## 🎯 Quick Start (for AI agents)

**Required Reading (in order):**
1. `images-plan.md` - Image support feature planning and task breakdown (main document)
2. `implementation.md` - What was actually built, architecture decisions, and PR fixes
3. `images-research.md` - Technical research for image implementation
4. `../../user-guide/images.md` - End-user documentation (optional)

**Quick Summary:**
Sprint 12 implemented core image functionality with Google Drive upload, WebP compression, and drag-to-resize. Tests were already in codebase (27+ integration tests). Only documentation was needed for Phase 7.

## 📚 Document Organization

| Document | Purpose | Status | Lines |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| images-plan.md | Feature planning, task breakdown, and completion tracking | ✅ Complete | 600+ |
| implementation.md | Developer documentation: what was built, architecture, fixes | ✅ Complete | 380 |
| images-research.md | Technical research for TipTap Image extension | ✅ Complete | 200+ |
| ../../user-guide/images.md | End-user guide: how to use images | ✅ Complete | 250 |

## 🔗 Related Sprints

**Prerequisites:**
- Sprint 11 (Tables) ✅ Complete - Established TipTap extension patterns

**Dependencies:**
- Sprint 8 (Google Drive Integration) ✅ Complete - OAuth and Drive API setup

## 📊 Sprint Status

- **Phase:** ✅ COMPLETED (Phases 1-3 + Phase 4 partial + Phase 7 complete)
- **Duration:** ~9 hours actual (vs 16-20 hours planned)
- **Completion:** 39/60 tasks (65%) - pragmatic approach
- **Branch:** `feat/sprint-12-images` (merged to main, deleted)
- **Merged:** October 20, 2025

### What Was Delivered

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Image insertion via `/image` slash command
- ✅ File picker with validation (10MB limit, PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP)
- ✅ Google Drive upload with WebP compression (60-80% reduction)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop image upload
- ✅ Image resizing with drag handles (tiptap-extension-resize-image)
- ✅ Block-level display (text flows underneath, not beside)
- ✅ Lazy loading for performance
- ✅ Persistent storage via Google Drive thumbnail endpoint

**Bug Fixes (PR Review):**
- ✅ Schema node type mismatch (`imageResize` vs `image`)
- ✅ Drop position race condition (captured before async upload)
- ✅ Memory leak in progress interval (`finally` block cleanup)

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Developer guide (implementation.md - 380 lines)
- ✅ User guide (images.md - 250 lines)
- ✅ Sprint plan updates with actual completion status

**Tests:**
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage already existed (27+ integration tests)
- ✅ Component tests for ImageUploader (7 tests)

### What Was Postponed

**Advanced Features (Future Sprints):**
- ⏳ Image positioning menu (left/center/right alignment)
- ⏳ Alt text dialog UI
- ⏳ Image captions (figcaption component)
- ⏳ Advanced editing (crop, rotate, filters)

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Key Technical Decisions:**

1. **Google Drive Thumbnail Endpoint**
   - Format: `/thumbnail?id={fileId}&sz=w2000`
   - Reason: Old `/uc?id=` format deprecated Jan 2024 (403 errors)

2. **WebP Compression**
   - Library: `browser-image-compression@2.0.2`
   - Reduction: 60-80% file size savings
   - Browser support: 97%+ (all modern browsers)

3. **Block-Level Display**
   - Override: `display: block !important` to remove `float: left`
   - Reason: User feedback - "text should flow UNDER image, not NEXT TO it"

4. **ResizableImageExtension**
   - Library: `tiptap-extension-resize-image@1.3.1`
   - Schema node: `imageResize` (NOT `image` - critical for drop handler)
   - Features: Drag handles, aspect ratio preservation

## 📦 Dependencies

**Production Packages Added:**
```json
{
  "@tiptap/extension-image": "^3.7.2",
  "tiptap-extension-resize-image": "^1.3.1",
  "browser-image-compression": "^2.0.2",
  "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.2",
  "@radix-ui/react-progress": "^1.1.0"
}
```

**Bundle Impact:** +156KB (minified)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Existing Test Coverage:**
- Integration tests: `tests/components/ImageUpload.test.tsx` (667 lines, 27+ tests)
- Component tests: `src/components/__tests__/ImageUploader.test.tsx` (134 lines, 7 tests)

**Test Categories:**
- Slash command flow (3 tests)
- File validation (3 tests)
- Google Drive upload (6 tests)
- Drag-and-drop (3 tests)
- Error handling (5+ tests)
- Performance (3 tests)

**Approach:**
- React Testing Library (RTL)
- Mock Drive API (no real OAuth/network)
- jsdom environment (no browser needed)
- Fast execution (<5 seconds total)

## 🚀 Build Metrics

**Final Production Build:**
- Bundle size: 1.1MB (minified)
- Build time: 3.98s
- TypeScript errors: 0
- Lint warnings: 0

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

**Files Created (5):**
1. `src/extensions/imageExtensions.ts` - TipTap image configuration
2. `src/services/drive/DriveImageUpload.ts` - Drive upload service
3. `src/components/ImageUploader.tsx` - Upload dialog component
4. `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Radix UI dialog
5. `src/components/ui/progress.tsx` - Radix UI progress

**Files Modified (4):**
1. `src/extensions/SlashCommands.tsx` - Added `/image` command
2. `src/components/Editor.tsx` - Added drag-drop handler, fixed PR bugs
3. `src/index.css` - Removed float:left styling
4. `src/services/drive/index.ts` - Export DriveImageUpload

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- **Pragmatic approach**: 39/60 tasks completed, core features working perfectly
- **Existing tests**: Saved ~3 hours by discovering comprehensive tests already existed
- **User feedback**: Block display decision validated by real user testing
- **PR review**: Caught 3 critical bugs before merge

**What Was Postponed:**
- **Advanced UI**: Positioning menu, alt text dialog (low priority for MVP)
- **Captions**: Can be added as separate paragraphs for now
- **Markdown conversion**: HTML-to-markdown working, markdown-to-HTML deferred

**Key Insight:**
"Less is better if quality is high" - Focused on core functionality (insert, upload, resize) rather than over-engineering with 60+ tasks.
