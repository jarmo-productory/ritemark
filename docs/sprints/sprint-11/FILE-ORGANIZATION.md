# Sprint 11 File Organization

## Directory Structure Created
**Location**: `/docs/sprints/sprint-11/`

## Files Moved and Renamed

### Core Sprint 11 Files (Table Feature)
1. `sprint-11-tables-plan.md` → `tables-plan.md`
2. `sprint-11-tables-research.md` → `tables-research.md`
3. `sprint-11-dependency-analysis.md` → `dependency-analysis.md`
4. `sprint-11-implementation-architecture.md` → `implementation-architecture.md`
5. `sprint-11-orchestration-summary.md` → `orchestration-summary.md`
6. `sprint-11-phase-breakdown.md` → `phase-breakdown.md`
7. `sprint-11-task-breakdown.md` → `task-breakdown.md`

### Research Phase Files (Sprint 11-12 Shared)
8. `sprint-11-12-codebase-audit.md` → `research-codebase-audit.md`
9. `sprint-11-12-execution-summary.md` → `research-execution-summary.md`

**Rationale for "sprint-11-12-*" files**: These files document the research phase that covered both Sprint 11 (tables) and Sprint 12 (images). They are placed in Sprint 11 because:
- The research phase was completed during Sprint 11 planning
- They provide context for Sprint 11 implementation decisions
- Renamed with "research-" prefix to indicate their cross-sprint nature

## Files Remaining in Parent Directory

### Sprint 12 Files (Images Feature)
- `sprint-12-images-plan.md` - Will be moved when Sprint 12 directory is created
- `sprint-12-images-research.md` - Will be moved when Sprint 12 directory is created

## Version Control
All files added to git with force flag due to `/docs/` being in `.gitignore` with exception for `!ritemark-app/docs/`.

## Coordination Status
- **Pre-task hook**: Registered with task ID `task-1760774832504-iib4fgcqp`
- **Memory storage**: File move progress stored in `.swarm/memory.db`
- **Post-task hook**: Task completion registered
- **Planner coordination**: Proceeded without planner analysis (not yet available in memory)
