# Landing Page Content Strategy - RiteMark

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Project**: RiteMark - "Google Docs for Markdown"
**Target Audience**: AI-native non-technical users (content creators, marketing teams, professionals)
**Strategic Position**: WYSIWYG editor with cloud collaboration + markdown output

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

RiteMark bridges the gap between technical markdown editors (too complex) and collaborative document editors (wrong output format). The landing page must communicate "familiar editing experience" (like Google Docs) with "developer-friendly output" (markdown) without exposing users to technical complexity.

**Key Insight**: Users don't want to learn markdown - they want visual editing that *happens* to produce markdown.

---

## 📊 Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Problem Space

**Technical Markdown Editors** (Typora, Bear, iA Writer):
- ❌ Expose markdown syntax (intimidating for non-technical users)
- ❌ Single-user focused (no real-time collaboration)
- ✅ Clean markdown output
- ✅ Fast, native performance

**Collaborative Document Editors** (Google Docs, Notion):
- ✅ Familiar WYSIWYG interface
- ✅ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ Export formats not developer-friendly
- ❌ Vendor lock-in

**RiteMark Positioning**:
- ✅ WYSIWYG interface (no markdown visible)
- ✅ Real-time collaboration (Google Drive integration)
- ✅ Clean markdown output
- ✅ No vendor lock-in (standard markdown files)
