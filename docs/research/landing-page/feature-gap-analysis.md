## ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (Promised in Landing Page)

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAP - Real-Time Collaboration

**Promised in Landing Page**:
> "Work Together in Real-Time"

## 🎯 Priority Matrix

### Must Have Before Public Launch

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Real-Time Collaboration** | 🔴 Critical | Very High (3-4 weeks) | Very High | **Sprint 15-18** or remove from landing page |
| **Share Button** | 🟡 Medium | Low (2 days) | Medium | **Sprint 15** - Quick win |
| **Version History UI** | 🟡 Medium | Medium (1 week) | Medium | **Sprint 16** - Leverage Drive API |
| **Offline Indicator** | 🟢 Low | Low (1 day) | Low | **Sprint 15** - Polish |

---

### Can Launch Without (Nice-to-Have)

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Comments/Suggestions** | 🟢 Low | High (depends on collab) | Medium | Post-collaboration feature |
| **SSG Templates** | 🟢 Low | Medium (3-5 days) | Low | Phase 2 enhancement |
| **AI Integration** | 🟢 Low | Very High (Milestone 3) | High | Planned for Sprints 13-18 |

## 🚨 Critical Decision Required

### Real-Time Collaboration Issue

**Problem**: Landing page promises real-time collaboration but it's not implemented.

**Options**:

**Option A: Remove from Landing Page** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Remove "Real-Time Collaboration" feature card
- Change headline to emphasize current strengths
- Add "Coming Soon" badge if mentioned
- **Pros**: Honest, no false promises
- **Cons**: Loses competitive edge vs Notion/Google Docs

**Option B: Add "Coming Soon" Badge**
- Keep feature card with visual "Coming Soon" overlay
- Set clear timeline ("Q1 2026")
- **Pros**: Shows roadmap, maintains positioning
- **Cons**: Can feel like vaporware

**Option C: Implement in Sprint 15-18**
- Full Y.js CRDT collaboration
- 3-4 weeks of work
- **Pros**: Landing page stays accurate
- **Cons**: Massive scope expansion, delays other features

## 📝 Recommended Landing Page Adjustments

### Remove/Replace Real-Time Collaboration

**Current Feature Card**:
> "Work Together in Real-Time"
> "See teammates' cursors and edits instantly..."

**Replacement Option 1** - Focus on Auto-Save:
> "Never Lose Your Work"
> "Auto-save to Google Drive every 3 seconds. Access from any device. Your documents are always backed up and synced."

**Replacement Option 2** - Focus on Markdown Export:
> "Export to Anywhere"
> "Clean markdown output works with ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub, Hugo, Jekyll, and any tool that reads markdown. No vendor lock-in."

**Replacement Option 3** - Focus on Table/Image Features:
> "Rich Content Editing"
> "Tables, images, code blocks, and formatted text. Upload images to your Drive, create data tables, and embed code examples visually."

---

## 🎯 Sprint 15 Recommendation

### Implement Quick Wins

**Instead of full collaboration**, implement these high-impact, low-effort features:

1. **Share Button** (2 days)
   - "Share" button in header
   - Opens Google Drive sharing dialog
   - Honest: "Share via Google Drive" (not "RiteMark collaboration")

2. **Offline Indicator** (1 day)
   - Toast notification when offline
   - "Working offline - changes will sync when online"

3. **Version History Link** (1 day)
   - "View Version History" link in file menu
   - Opens Google Drive version history in new tab
   - Leverages existing Drive feature

4. **Export Templates** (3 days)
   - "Export for Hugo" (adds YAML frontmatter)
   - "Export for Jekyll" (adds Jekyll-compatible frontmatter)
   - "Copy for AI Tools" (clipboard copy with prompt template)

**Total**: ~1 week vs 3-4 weeks for collaboration

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Main Gap**: Real-Time Collaboration is promised but not built

**Recommended Action**:
1. **Remove collaboration** from landing page MVP
2. **Replace with existing features** (tables, images, auto-save)
3. **Implement quick wins** in Sprint 15 (share, offline, export templates)
4. **Plan collaboration** for Milestone 3 (Sprint 15-18+) with proper timeline

**Result**: Honest landing page + feature velocity + user trust

---

**Next Step**: Get user approval on which approach to take for landing page content.
