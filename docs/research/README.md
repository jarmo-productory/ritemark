# Research Documentation Organization

This folder contains all research documentation for the RiteMark project, organized into logical subdirectories.

## Directory Structure

### `/editors/` - Editor Technology Research
Research and analysis of editor frameworks and technologies:
- **milkdown-analysis.md** - Milkdown framework evaluation
- **tiptap-block-insertion-architecture.md** - TipTap block insertion system design
- **tiptap-slash-commands-analysis.md** - TipTap slash command implementation analysis

### `/ux/` - User Experience Research
User experience patterns and analysis for non-technical users:
- **block-insertion-ux-patterns.md** - UX patterns for block-based content insertion
- **ux-analysis-non-technical-users.md** - UX requirements for AI-native non-technical users

### `/integrations/` - Third-Party Integration Research
Research on external service integrations:
- **ai-integration-architecture.md** - AI writing assistance architecture
- **google-drive-integration-analysis.md** - Google Drive API integration patterns

### `/archived/` - Historical Sprint Research
Obsolete sprint-specific research documents (kept for historical reference):
- **sprint-6-enhanced-features-research.md** - Sprint 6 feature research
- **sprint-7-oauth-research.md** - Sprint 7 OAuth implementation research
- **sprint-10-in-context-formatting-audit.md** - Sprint 10 formatting audit

## Related Documentation

### OAuth & Security Research
OAuth-related research has been moved to `/docs/security/oauth/`:
- google-oauth-setup-2025.md
- oauth-architecture-summary.md
- oauth-component-integration.md
- oauth-service-architecture.md

## Usage Guidelines

1. **New research documents** should be placed in the appropriate subdirectory
2. **Sprint-specific research** should go in `/docs/sprints/sprint-XX.md` instead of here
3. **Security research** belongs in `/docs/security/` or its subdirectories
4. **Archive old research** when it becomes obsolete or is superseded by newer documentation

## Document Organization Principles

- **Editors**: Technology-specific implementation research
- **UX**: User experience patterns and usability studies
- **Integrations**: Third-party service integration patterns
- **Archived**: Historical documents no longer actively referenced
