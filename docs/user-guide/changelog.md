## November 1, 2025 - Your Settings Sync Everywhere

**Pick Up Where You Left Off** 🔄

Your editor preferences now sync automatically across all your devices. Change your font size on your laptop, and it's already updated on your phone.

### What Syncs
- **Editor preferences** - Font size, font family, theme (light/dark)
- **Auto-save settings** - Your preferred auto-save timing
- **It just works** - Changes sync in the background every 30 seconds
- **Private and secure** - Everything is encrypted before syncing to your Google Drive

### How It Works
- **Automatic syncing** - No buttons to click, it happens behind the scenes
- **Works offline** - Settings load instantly from your device's cache
- **Cross-device** - Start editing on desktop, continue on mobile
- **No setup needed** - Just sign in with Google and it's enabled

**Technical Note:** Settings are stored encrypted in your Google Drive's private app folder. Only you can access them.
