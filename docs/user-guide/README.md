## 📋 Frequently Asked Questions

### What is RiteMark?
RiteMark is a **WYSIWYG markdown editor** for people who hate markdown syntax. You edit visually (like Google Docs), collaborate in real-time, and export clean markdown for AI tools, GitHub, and developer workflows.

### Is RiteMark free?
**Yes!** RiteMark is free and open-source. Your documents are stored in your Google Drive (15 GB free tier, or upgrade to Google One for more storage).

### Do I need to know markdown?
**No!** That's the whole point. You edit visually, and RiteMark handles the markdown conversion automatically. The only time you see markdown is when you export.

### Is my data secure?
**Yes.** RiteMark uses Google OAuth for authentication and stores your documents in **your own Google Drive**. We only access files you create or open with RiteMark—we never see your other Drive files.

### Can I use RiteMark offline?
**Partially.** You can edit documents offline, and your changes will save locally. When you're back online, RiteMark syncs your changes to Google Drive automatically.

### How is RiteMark different from Notion or Google Docs?

**vs Notion:**
- ✅ RiteMark exports **clean markdown** (Notion uses proprietary format)
- ✅ Files stay in **your Google Drive** (Notion stores in their cloud)
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** - your markdown works everywhere

**vs Google Docs:**
- ✅ RiteMark outputs **markdown** (Google Docs exports .docx)
- ✅ Optimized for **AI tools, GitHub, and developer workflows** (not for printing)
- ✅ **Real-time collaboration** like Google Docs, but for markdown

### What can I do with exported markdown?
- 📝 **AI Tools**: Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI assistants
- 📦 **GitHub**: Add to repositories (README.md, documentation)
- 🌐 **Static Sites**: Use with Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js
- 📱 **Notion/Obsidian**: Import into other markdown-compatible tools
- 🤝 **Developer Handoff**: Share clean, structured content with developers

### Can I collaborate with others?
**Yes!** Share your Google Drive `.md` file with teammates. Everyone can edit the same file in RiteMark simultaneously, just like Google Docs. Changes sync in real-time.

### What formatting is supported?
- **Text**: Bold, italic, strikethrough
- **Headings**: 6 levels (# through ######)
- **Lists**: Bullet points, numbered lists, nested lists
- **Links**: Auto-linking URLs and custom link text
- **Images**: Upload, resize, drag-and-drop
- **Tables**: Create and edit markdown tables
- **Code blocks**: Inline code and code blocks
- **Quotes**: Blockquotes for emphasis

### Does RiteMark work on mobile?
**Yes!** RiteMark is mobile-first and works on iOS and Android devices. The interface adapts to smaller screens with touch-friendly controls.

### How much does Google Drive storage cost?
- **Free tier**: 15 GB (shared across Gmail, Drive, Photos)
- **Google One**: 100 GB for $1.99/month
- **Unlimited**: Google Workspace for businesses

Most users never exceed the 15 GB free tier for markdown documents (text files are tiny!).
