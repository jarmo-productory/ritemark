# Getting Started with RiteMark

Welcome to RiteMark! This guide will help you create your first document in 5 minutes.

## What is RiteMark?

RiteMark is a **WYSIWYG markdown editor** designed for people who need markdown output but prefer visual editing. Think of it as "Google Docs for Markdown" - you edit visually, we handle the markdown conversion automatically.

**Perfect for:**
- Content creators who need markdown for AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Marketing teams collaborating on documentation
- GitHub contributors who prefer visual editing
- Anyone who wants markdown output without learning markdown syntax

## Tips for Success

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive file names**: "Q4-Marketing-Plan.md" is better than "document.md"
2. **Add headings**: Helps with navigation and exports better markdown
3. **Save regularly**: Though auto-save works, manually save important changes (file menu)
4. **Use version history**: Experiment freely, you can always restore
5. **Test markdown output**: Copy to clipboard and check format before final use

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Don't** manually add markdown syntax (like `**bold**`) - use visual formatting instead
‚ùå **Don't** forget to sign in - your work needs Google Drive to save
‚ùå **Don't** close browser before "Synced" appears - wait for save to complete
‚ùå **Don't** edit the same file in multiple tabs - stick to one tab per document

‚úÖ **Do** use headings to structure content
‚úÖ **Do** check sync status before closing
‚úÖ **Do** export frequently to verify markdown output
‚úÖ **Do** use version history for peace of mind
